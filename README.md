Face generation results in VoxCeleb test sequences by FAP-GAN (6 out of 15 sequences). Input is the 150th frame out of 250 frames, Intra-frame is the first frame of the video sequence, Original is the original face frame, and FAP-GAN is the face frame generated by FAP-GAN within the VVC-GFVC framework. Input is compressed by VTM 22.2 in LDB configuration at QP 52, while Intra-frame is compressed by VTM 22.2 in LDB configuration at QP 22.
